A hand with delicate fingers picks up a bright yellow lemon from a wooden bowl filled with lemons and sprigs of mint against a peach-colored background. The hand gently tosses the lemon up and catches it, showcasing its smooth texture. A beige string bag sits beside the bowl, adding a rustic touch to the scene. Additional lemons, one halved, are scattered around the base of the bowl. The even lighting enhances the vibrant colors and creates a fresh, inviting atmosphere.
