# FastVideo/assets/videos

This folder is used to store **video assets for examples**, primarily **input videos** consumed by scripts under `FastVideo/examples/`.

- **Typical contents**: short input clips for demos (e.g., video2world / image2video examples).
- **Non-critical**: these assets are for convenience and are not required to use the FastVideo library.
- **Large files**: avoid committing large videos to git; prefer shared storage or download-on-demand.
