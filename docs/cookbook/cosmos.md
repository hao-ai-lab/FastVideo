      <ul>
        <li>World-generation prompts work best describing a scene and camera motion; the built-in prompt in the example is a known-good starting point.</li>
        <li>Gated or missing checkpoints: run <code>huggingface-cli login</code> and confirm you accepted the model's license on Hugging Face.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All recipes on this page are <strong>Source-backed</strong>: their commands, model IDs, and flags were validated against the checked-in FastVideo sources listed above (static validation). No runtime GPU validation is recorded for these recipes, so GPU model fit, memory use, throughput, and runtime duration are <strong>Unknown</strong> and deliberately not claimed. Runtime buttons show only the GPU counts configured in checked-in sources.</p>
