      <p>The generated commands expect a local clone:</p>
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.git
cd FastVideo</code></pre>
      <p>Use <a href="../../inference/configuration/">Configuration</a> for supported Python and CLI settings, <a href="../../inference/optimizations/">Optimizations</a> for attention and memory tradeoffs, and the <a href="../../inference/support_matrix/">support matrix</a> for the supported model and optimization surface.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The distilled recipe is source-configured for four GPUs; running it on fewer GPUs is unverified and may fail during distributed setup.</li>
        <li>Audio-less output usually means the base checkpoint resolved instead of the distilled LTX-2 checkpoint with audio; check the loaded model ID in the logs.</li>
        <li>Gated or missing checkpoints: run <code>huggingface-cli login</code> and confirm you accepted the model's license on Hugging Face.</li>
      </ul>

  <summary>Evidence status</summary>
  <div >
      <p>All recipes on this page are <strong>Source-backed</strong>: their commands, model IDs, and flags were validated against the checked-in FastVideo sources listed above (static validation). No runtime GPU validation is recorded for these recipes, so GPU model fit, memory use, throughput, and runtime duration are <strong>Unknown</strong> and deliberately not claimed. Runtime buttons show only the GPU counts configured in checked-in sources.</p>
