# Inference In FastVideo

This section will go into detail the design and API for inference in FastVideo. To get started quickly we recommend trying out some of our examples.

## Overview

FastVideo's inference system provides efficient, distributed video generation through a simple yet expressive API.

To achieve this, we designed a flexible abstraction layer that supports multiple diffusion pipelines, making it easy to add new features and maintain existing functionality.
