The senior frog instructor sits cross-legged at the center, eyes closed, voice deep and calm. “We are one with the pond.” All the frogs answer softly: “Ommm...” “We are one with the mud.” “Ommm...” He smiles faintly. “We are one with the flies.” A quiet pause.

The master exhales slowly, still serene.",
