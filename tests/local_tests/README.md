# Local LTX-2 Tests

These tests depend on a checked-out `LTX-2/` directory under the repo root
(`FastVideo/LTX-2`). Without that local repo, the tests will skip or fail.

For the CI-backed test suite, see `fastvideo/tests/`. Those are the tests
currently exercised in CI. (Eventually all tests will move to `tests/`.)
